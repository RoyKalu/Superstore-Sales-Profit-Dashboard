# Superstore Sales & Profit Dashboard

## Project Overview

This repository hosts the **Superstore Sales & Profit Dashboard**, an interactive business intelligence tool built to visualize and analyze the sales and profitability of a fictional superstore from 2014 to 2018. The dashboard offers a comprehensive view of key business metrics, enabling stakeholders to quickly understand performance trends, identify top-performing areas, and pinpoint challenges.

## Key Features & Insights

The dashboard emphasizes intuitive visualization and actionable insights, including:

- **Executive Summary KPIs:**
  - **Total Sales:** Overall revenue generated.
  - **Total Profit:** Net profit earned.
  - **Average Order Value:** Insights into customer spending habits.
  - **Total Quantity Sold:** Volume of products sold.  
  These KPIs provide an immediate high-level snapshot of the store’s financial health.

- **Geographical Performance Analysis:**
  - **Top 15 Cities in Sales:** Highlights highest revenue-generating cities (e.g., New York City, Los Angeles, Seattle).
  - **Profit by Region:** Breaks down profitability by region (West, South, East, Central) to compare regional performance.

- **Temporal Sales Trends:**
  - **Sales Over Time:** Visualizes sales fluctuations, seasonality, and overall trends from 2014 to 2018 using a moving sum.

- **Product Category Profitability:**
  - **Profit by Category:** Identifies which product sub-categories drive profit (e.g., Copiers, Phones) and which incur losses (e.g., Art, Envelopes), helping guide inventory and marketing decisions.

- **Sales vs. Profit Relationship:**
  - **Sales vs Profit by City:** Scatter plot illustrating correlation between sales and profit by city, highlighting efficiency and outliers.

## Technologies Used

- **Tableau Public:** Primary tool for data visualization and dashboard creation.
- **Kaggle Superstore Sales Dataset:** Data extracted from a sample Superstore Excel dataset.
